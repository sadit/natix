Natix is a polyphasic library implementing state of the art methods in the following areas:

- Similarity search algorithms
  - Exact indexes
  - Approximate indexes
- Compressed (and compact) data-structures
  - Indexed bitmaps
  - Indexed sequences
  - Indexed permutations
  - Sorted and unsorted lists of integers
  - Integer encoders
- Fulltext indexes
  - Inverted lists
  - Intersection algorithms
  - T-Threshold algorithms
  - Union-Intersection algorithms
- Searching and sorting algorithms and structures
  - Numeric sorting
  - Comparison based algorithms - sorting and searching
  - Adaptive searching/sorting with SkipLists

The library is primarily designed for experimental testing of algorithms, but it is robust enought to be used in many practical applications. Moreover, it is opensource.
