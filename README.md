The natix library
================


Natix is an opensource (Apache 2.0) library with state of the art
methods in the following areas:


* Similarity and metric search
 - Exact indexes
 - Approximate indexes
* Compressed (and compact) data-structures
 - Indexed bitmaps
 - Indexed sequences
 - Indexed permutations
 - Sorted and unsorted lists of integers
 - Integer encoders
* Fulltext indexes
 - Inverted lists
 - Intersection algorithms
 - T-Threshold algorithms
 - Union-Intersection algorithms
* Searching and sorting algorithms and structures
 - Numeric sorting
 - Comparison based algorithms - sorting and searching
 - Adaptive searching/sorting with SkipLists


Natix is designed for experimentation and testing of
algorithms. However, it should be robust enough to be of use in application
development.


Requirements:
-------------

Natix has few dependencies

* A running Mono/.NET environment. We use the [mono framework](http://www.mono-project.com) in Linux.
* [JSon.NET](http://www.newtonsoft.com) from Newtonsof
* (Optional) An IDE to modify the C# project Monodevelop / XamarinStudio / #Develop / VisualStudio. We use [monodevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com) in Linux.
